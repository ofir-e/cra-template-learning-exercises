# cra-template-learning-exercises

react must have interactive hands on learning exercises

To start practicing use create react app cli.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template learning-exercises

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template learning-exercises
```

and thats it! now you have the project and can start the exercise using

```sh
npm start
```

the exercise will open in localhost:300

you can even debug your ts react code thru vscode using f5 (after npm start)
which will open it in chrome and will be debugged in your vscode

the exercises are located in exercises folder
each exercise have a single file named ex(number here).tsx that you need to fix
in each file you have instructions on what you are allowed to change
good luck!
